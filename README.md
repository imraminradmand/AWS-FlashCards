# AWS-FlashCards
Mini project built for students trying to receive their AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification to help them study.
As I, myself am working towards this certification I thought it would be a great opportunity to create a simple flashcard app rather than going through multiple different website trying to prepare for my exam.
